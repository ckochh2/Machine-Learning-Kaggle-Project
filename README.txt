young-people-survey

Data exploration, visualization and machine learning project on the "Young People Survey" Dataset on Kaggle.

Question : You have joined a startup that delivers healthy meals to people. You have been tasked with doing a marketing study and understanding how likely a person is to “pay more money for good, quality or healthy food” (on a scale from 1 to 5) using the Young People Survey dataset
(https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey/). You can use any of the other attributes in the dataset to make this prediction.

Here, we will explore a small dataset (1010 samples) taken from a survey done by an introductory statistics class at FSEV UK. Some notes on this dataset: The range of available features gives more than sufficient leeway to really explore and demonstrate a variety of methods for data exploration and machine learning. The shortcoming of the data, however, is two-fold: (1) the size (number of samples) is quite small at 1010, making generalization and the construction of a robust model difficult, and (2) in virtue of being survey data, the data might vaguely suggest, but not fully represent a true function between input and output variables.

We'll break this notebook into the following sections:

1. Data Processing and Feature Engineering
2. Machine Learning and Prediction
3. Evaluation

Download the DataSet and run the main.py file
